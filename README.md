▶️# Day-1-Of-Learning-Python

From many days I want to learn Python language like an expert.
I created my account on github to show peaple my progress along with teaching and learning python like a beginner.
One of my friend @Pieater, who is also using Github to present his projects, suggested me to use Github and work with him in his projects.
So, I joined this huge community as a beginner 🔰 and will learn as I proceed more with Github community.

Thank You and stay connected!
